# Intro üëã

<p>Hi everyone ! Today I'm introducing my last project to you - Chat App üí¨ </p>
<br>
<p>As majority of my projects - it evolved from simple exercise. I was training some SQL skills and authorization features. After completing this I've added some features to my code, some table to postgreSQL. And here it is !</p>
<br>

<p>To manage backend features I used <b>supabase</b> and to deploy the Project - <b>Vercel<b>
<br>
<br>

# Buttons 
* Log Off button - top-right corner. Just to log Off the user

<br>
<br>

# ToDos 
* Pagination or filtering only last 20 messages - to improve performance of an App
* Styles fix - for now media queries are only available over 500px. Under this value content may be displayed incorrectly
* Styles add - This project was mainly developed for training SQL skills so styles was just the background. But as Frontend Dev - I don't want to leave it like that.
* Features - some extras
